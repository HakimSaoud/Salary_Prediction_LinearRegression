# Salary Prediction with Linear Regression

**Description:**

This Python script implements a Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on features in the `salaries.csv` dataset. It demonstrates key steps in data analysis and machine learning:

* Data loading and exploration
* Feature selection and extraction
* Train-test split for model validation
* Linear Regression model training
* Prediction and evaluation
* Visualization of results

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

**Installation:**

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

**Usage:**

1. **Download the `salaries.csv` dataset:** Ensure it's in the same directory as this code.
2. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script `salary.pynb`
